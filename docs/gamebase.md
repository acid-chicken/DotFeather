# Inherit GameBase

In DotFeather, you define a inherited class from GameBase and write main loop
into it.

```cs
public class Game : GameBase
{
	public Game(int width, int height, string title = null, int refreshRate = 60)
		: base(width, height, title, refreshRate) { }
}
```

**Hereafter, the class you defined will be called "Game" in this document.**

## Entrypoint

Same as other C# program, your code will be begin from the `Main()` method.
Write the following statement into `Main()` to run the game class.

```cs
static void Main()
{
	using (var g = new Game(320, 240))
	{
		g.Run();
	}
}
```

## Event Hook

You should override virtual methods from GameBase and write main loop, loading
assets etc into it. I will describe virtual methods from GameBase:

| Method       | Description                                                                            |
| ------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| OnLoad()     | will be called when the game begin. Load resources and savedata here.                  |
| OnUpdate()   | will be called every frame update. Write main loop.                                    |
| OnResize()   | will be called when size of the game window is changed.                                |
| OnUnload()   | will be called when the game is ended. Use for auto-saving or disposing any resources. |
| OnDragDrop() | will be called when a file is dragged and dropped.                                     |

## Properties

You can set properties to customize the game window etc.

| Property        | Description                                            |

| Y               | Y-coord of the window                                  |
| Width           | width of the window                                    |
| Height          | height of the window                                   |

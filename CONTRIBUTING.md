## Coding Style

Basically I compliant
[C# Coding Conventions (Official)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/inside-a-program/coding-conventions).
Moreover, follow the rules below:

-   Use 4-character tabs for indentation
-   DON'T make fields `public`
-   Define members of classes and structs the following orders: + Properties +
    Constructor(s) + If have many ones, arrange in ascending order of
    arguments. + Methods + Overridden Methods + Fields + Nested classes, structs
    and interfaces + Delegates
-   If you overload methods, locate them adjacently.
-   Define an entrypoint method in a dedicated `static` class.
-   Make string-variables non-null, and initialize them with empty string.
